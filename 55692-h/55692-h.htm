<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p><i>The object of the following few pages is to provide
a basis of instruction in the surgical aspect of the
Jewish rite of circumcision. The performance of
this simple operation is not limited to medical men.
It is therefore essential that the lay Mohel should
possess a scientific knowledge of the important task
he undertakes.</i></p>

<p><i>The Initiation Society which controls the instruction
of Mohelim has arranged a Syllabus which guarantees
such an acquaintance with the subject. This little
book is planned in accordance with that syllabus. Its
main object is to bring the principles of <em class="smcap">Asepsis</em> within
the information of everyone acting as a Mohel,
and to insist upon the urgent need of carrying these
principles into practice.</i></p>

<span class="smaller u">Infection of Wounds.</span></h2>

<p>The greatest advance in modern surgery has been
to show how wounds become infected and cause
general blood poisoning. This applies both to
wounds made by the knife of the Surgeon as well
as to accidental injuries. <em>The principles concerned
in this matter involve not only the arrangements
necessary for a severe and prolonged operation but
also those required for the simple circumcision of an
infant.</em> It is therefore essential that those who
perform ritual circumcision should be familiar with
the elementary teachings of the <em>Antiseptic System
of Surgery</em> which is now universally adopted even
in the most trifling surgical proceedings.</p>

<p>Heavy responsibility lies upon the Mohel to carry
out every case strictly in accord with the lessons of
surgical cleanliness. <em>Surgical Cleanliness</em> begins
where ordinary cleanliness leaves off. Its object is
to destroy certain minute particles of matter which
are invisible to the naked eye, but which are <em>living
organisms of a vegetable nature</em>, able to grow very
luxuriantly in blood, and wound discharges. Here
they produce a poison which gets absorbed into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
body, causing serious symptoms of disease; or they
themselves enter the blood stream and circulate in
it with even more disastrous results. These organisms
can be observed under the microscope, but can
only be seen by the naked eye when growing together
in colonies after being planted in such substances
as gelatine or broth, or on the surface of a slice of
potato. They correspond exactly to the growth of
<em>mould or fungus</em> on stale cheese or meat, or to the
growth of yeast in fermenting grape juice. When
seen separately under the microscope, or when growing
in the mass they possess very distinct characters
so that the expert is able to distinguish the one
from the other, with the same confidence as a pear
may be distinguished from a fig.</p>

<p>A large number of diseases is due to the growth
in the body of certain of these organisms, and in
many diseases we can be sure of always finding the
particular one responsible for the condition, either
in the blood or in the discharges from the body.
This is notably the case in Consumption, Typhoid
Fever, and Malarial Fever. We often know how the
organism has obtained entrance into the body; it
may be either by the lungs or the stomach, or in
other words through air or through food.</p>

<p>We are however only concerned just now with the
<em>organisms which enter the body by means of an open
wound</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>These nearly all belong to one class&mdash;<em>micro-cocci</em>.
They are minute round bodies about 1/25000 inch
in diameter. They possess the peculiarity of growing
together in clusters like grapes, or in chains. They
are responsible for the diseased conditions of wounds
which delay healing, for inflammation around
wounds and for the general blood-poisoning which
may result.</p>

<p>These organisms are very abundant in the dust
of rooms, on dirty clothes and unclean general
surroundings, and there can be no doubt that
everybody is often infected by them. But fortunately
disease results only rarely, because there are
special powers resident in the vital tissues which
enable them successfully to resist the poisonous
effects of these organisms. There are however
certain circumstances in which they are liable to
be more harmful than in others.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>1</i>) <em>When they are absorbed in especially large
numbers.</em></p>

<p><i>2</i>) <em>When absorbed in an especially active state.</em></p>

<p><i>3</i>) <em>When the body is in a condition of ill-health
from whatever cause.</em></p>

<p><i>4</i>) <em>In the presence of cold.</em></p>

</div>

<p>Each one of these circumstances is of special
importance in relation to circumcision and may be
commented on as follows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>1) The slightest departure from scrupulous cleanliness
either on the genitals of the infant, on the
instruments or dressings used, or on the hands of
the Mohel enormously increases the number of
microbes which may possibly infect the wound.
<em>Hence the necessity for absolute ordinary cleanliness
before resorting to antiseptic measures.</em></p>

<p>2) It is well known that these organisms exist in
a very virulent form in unhealthy wounds, in boils
and in abscesses, and the worst cases of blood
poisoning have resulted from the direct infection
of a healthy wound from an unhealthy one. For
this reason all the precautions in regard to the
disinfection of the hands, which will be referred to
subsequently, must be carried out with rigorous
care, when there has been any possibility of their
having come in contact with such sources of infection.</p>

<p>3) The natural protective power of the body
against infection is diminished when the general
health is below the normal standard. This occurs
in infants mainly, when they are premature, or
suffering from jaundice, sickness or diarrhÅa, congenital
disease of the heart or other organs. In
these circumstances the circumcision must be
delayed.</p>

<p>When the parts are unduly bruised, the local
resistance is considerably lowered; hence the paramount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
necessity of the operation being performed
neatly and dexterously.</p>

<p>If these micro-cocci have already found access to
the body in other parts, as evidenced by <em>purulent
ophthalmia</em> (i.e. matter discharging from the eye lids)
or <em>suppuration about the navel</em>, it is important that
these conditions be cured before the circumcision is
undertaken, because experience shows that in their
presence the risks of a general blood infection are
increased.</p>

<p>4) There is a special liability for the skin of an
infant, particularly in the region of the scrotum, to
become irritated by its excretions and to present
the eruption known as <em>eczema</em>. The folds of the
groin occasionally suffer in the same way, the skin
becoming reddened and peeling. These cases demand
medical attention before operation, owing to
special risks of infection. <em>No infant presenting a
rash of any kind should be circumcised without previous
examination by a doctor, because it may indicate
constitutional disease.</em></p>

<p>5) Cold always indicates that the bodily processes
are deficient in activity. Infants are especially liable
to cold, and hence the necessity to supply them with
abundant artificial warmth. This is especially required
during the exposure which a circumcision
involves, and therefore due attention must be paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
to the temperature of the room where the operation
takes place, draughts must be avoided, and adequate
protection of the infant when carried from and to
the bedroom, must be ensured.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller u">Results of the Infection of Wounds.</span></h2>

<p>The name usually given to the conditions which
result from wound infection is <em>Septic Disease</em>. This
includes both the mild and the grave troubles which
may ensue.</p>

<p>The mild forms of infection usually appear as
interference with the rapid healing of the circumcision
wound. The principal of these are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1) Ulceration at the cut edge of the prepuce.</p>

<p>2) Ulceration in the raw tissue left on the under
surface of the penis between the reflected
mucous membrane and the cut skin.</p>

<p>3) Sloughing or mortification of the reflected
mucous membrane.</p>

</div>

<p>These conditions are usually attended with some
amount of swelling; and the unhealthy state of the
wound with the accompanying discharge afford a
fertile soil for the rapid growth and multiplication
of micro-organisms and their absorption into the
system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the more serious results of infection the principal
is <em>Erysipelas</em> in its various forms. Here we find
that as the signs of unhealthy inflammation around
the wound occur, symptoms of constitutional illness
begin. The infant becomes feverish, there is loss
of appetite, rapid breathing and wasting supervene,
with a profound alteration in the general appearance.
The signs evident, locally, are redness of the skin
increasing to a vivid blush which spreads on to the
thighs, scrotum or abdomen. The surface is tender,
and the edge of the red patch is sharply defined
from the surrounding healthy skin. The disease is
most active at this sharp margin for it is there that
the micro-cocci may be found in abundance. The
glands in the groin become swollen and tender, and
the circumcision wound, failing to heal will probably
inflame and suppurate. While this is going on, a
poison is being manufactured by the microbes in
their growth, and this poison being absorbed into
the circulation, generally proves fatal to the infant.</p>

<p>The process is usually limited to the skin, and its
uppermost layer is often raised into blebs containing
clear or discoloured blood serum. But the morbid
change may take place first in the tissues under the
skin, when there will be great swelling and dropsy
of the part so that the pressure of the finger will
leave a pit in the skin before the latter becomes
itself inflamed. In these cases the organisms readily
enter the blood stream and being carried away to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
distant organs set up infection in these. These are
necessarily the most hopeless cases of blood-poisoning.</p>

<p>So far we have briefly considered infection by the
group of organisms known as micro-cocci. It is
necessary to point out here that at least two of
the organisms of the group of <em>Bacilli</em> have been
known to infect the circumcision wound. The one
is the Tetanus (lockjaw) Bacillus, the other is the
Tubercle Bacillus.</p>

<p>In <em>Tetanus</em> the first symptom noticed is that the
infant is unable to suck, and on examination it will
be found that this is due to cramp of the muscles of
the jaw, which become fixed and hard. The face
assumes a peculiar aspect which is quite characteristic
of this disease, spasms of the limbs and then
convulsions of the whole body take place, the joints
become stiff and the case is almost invariably fatal.</p>

<p>In regard to the infection by the Tubercle Bacillus
it may be said that this occurrence is one of the
rarest of the rare sequels of circumcision, but it
appears that <em>tubercular ulcers</em> have arisen over the
area of the wound when the <span class="smcap">Metzizah</span> has been performed
by mouth suction on the part of a Mohel
who was suffering from Tuberculosis. A number
of these cases have been reported from time to time,
and in some of them it apparently led to general
Tuberculosis (<em>consumption</em>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>The foregoing brief statements exhaust most of the
possibilities of wound infection by means of micro-organisms.
There is however another source of
infection, not yet definitely proved to be of microbic
origin, which has important relations to circumcision.
This is the poison of <em>Syphilis</em>. If the Mohel
should be suffering from this disease the secretions
of the mouth are infective and the disease may easily
be transmitted to the infant by means of Metzizah.
On the other hand, should the infant be born with
the disease&mdash;a circumstance of not infrequent
occurrence&mdash;it must be remembered that its blood
is charged with the poison, and is capable of infecting
a healthy individual when it is brought
into contact with any wound, abrasion or other
breach of surface.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smaller u">Elements of the Antiseptic Method.</span></h2>

<p><em>The purpose of Antiseptic Surgery is to avoid the
occurrence of the dangers of infection</em> referred to in
the preceding chapter. There are many methods of
carrying out the system, but the present description
being limited to the requirements of circumcision
does not aim at being exhaustive. The two objects
aimed at are:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1) <em>The prevention of any micro-organisms gaining
entrance to the wound.</em> This end is attained
by the disinfection of the hands and especially
the thumbnails of the operator, of the
instruments and dressings used; and by
perfect cleanliness of the genitals of the
infant. It may be said that the brief exposure
of the parts during the performance of the
circumcision carries with it no risk of
infection, because the organisms we have
been considering are not usually airborne.</p>

<p>2) <em>The application of such dressings as will keep
the wound in an aseptic condition.</em> Even
the small amount of discharge from a circumcision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
wound forms a splendid soil for the
growth of micro-organisms. It is necessary
therefore to apply a dressing which has been
saturated with such antiseptics as will destroy
that constituent of the discharge which
makes it a good culture material.</p>

</div>

<p>The most convenient antiseptic for general use is
<em>Carbolic Acid</em>. This is a clear, colourless liquid of
rather oily consistence, which rapidly becomes
converted into solid crystals in cold weather. When
required for purposes of disinfection it should be
mixed with 39 times its quantity of water, or roughly
one pint of water requires one tablespoonful of pure
Carbolic Acid to make a solution of 1 in 40.</p>

<p>This solution is required for soaking the hands
after they have been washed with soap and warm
water, and the nails scrubbed with a nail brush.
This latter proceeding is one of <em>ordinary cleanliness</em>,
the soaking in the Carbolic Acid solution, which
should be warm, is in order to obtain <em>Surgical
Cleanliness</em>. It will be readily understood, that if
the hands come in contact with any possible source
of infection after this soaking, then it must be
repeated before beginning the operation. The disinfection
of the hands must be the last stage in all
the preparations for the circumcision. A similar
solution of 1 in 40 Carbolic Acid may be used for
placing the instruments in before the operation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
They are to be taken directly out of the solution as
required. A shallow dish of a material easily cleaned,
as metal, glass or porcelain should be filled with 2Â½
ounces (5 tablespoons) of water which has been
boiled, and to this one half a teaspoonful of Carbolic
Acid is added, taking care that the acid is thoroughly
well mixed up with the water and not allowed to
float about in droplets.</p>

<p>If the instruments are scrupulously clean, i.e., if
they have been washed thoroughly with soap and
hot water, they require to remain for <em>one hour</em> in the
Carbolic Acid solution to render them sufficiently
disinfected for operating purposes. It is therefore
quicker, as it is also more scientific, to <em>sterilize the
instruments before using them</em>. By sterilizing them
we kill any micro-organisms that may be present on
them, and we are then confident that no living
germs are carried to the wound by means of the
instruments. In other words they are <em>aseptic</em>.
Instruments are sterilized by boiling for about ten
minutes in clean water. It is useful to add washing
soda in the proportion of 5 grains to every two
tablespoons of water. It is obvious that the instruments
must be of metal, as no other material will
stand boiling. They must be made in such a way
as to prevent the accumulation of dust or dirt in
joints or crevices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Compact apparatus for sterilization is supplied
by every surgical instrument maker. The instruments
are usually placed on a wire gauze tray with
handles and then into the sterilizing dish, so that
when the boiling is completed, they are lifted out on
this tray by means of hooks supplied for the purpose.
They are at once transferred to the shallow dish
containing the 1 in 40 Carbolic Acid solution detailed
above. By these means the instruments are
cooled ready for use, for obviously they cannot be
taken directly out of the boiling water with the
fingers; and the fact that they are in an antiseptic
solution, prevents the access of any germs during
the short interval before they are actually handled.</p>

<p>The <em>dressings</em> used in Circumcision should consist
only of <em>lint</em> and <em>gauze</em>. It is necessary that the
dressing should be sterilized and also impregnated
with some antiseptic so as to render harmless any
infective material which may accidentally contaminate
the wound after circumcision. These
dressings are supplied by manufacturers, already
sterilized by exposure to super-heated steam, and
rendered antiseptic by various chemical agents.
Carbolic Acid used for the hands and the instruments,
is often employed for the dressings, the
antiseptic being fixed in the lint and the gauze by a
special process. Most surgeons, however, prefer
â<em>double cyanide</em>â dressings, in which the antiseptic
used is a salt known as cyanide of zinc and mercury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>From the first dressing until the circumcision is
absolutely healed nothing but gauze need be used.
In a normal case no other application of any kind
whatsoever is required. It is usual however in
applying the first dressing at the circumcision to
use lint to surround the root of the penis as it is
firmer than gauze. When this is done a piece of
tape is twisted round the lint to retain it in position.
The tape and the lint must both be sterilized like
the gauze.</p>

<p>The best course to adopt in regard to the dressings
is to obtain them from a reliable firm of manufacturers,
who will supply them ready cut to the
pattern required, packed in small sealed aseptic
tin cases ready for use.</p>

<p>Having adopted all these precautions the Mohel
may be confident that in regard to his own hands,
the instruments, and the dressings he has exercised
every care which surgical science demands. The
only other important detail which demands attention
is the part concerned in circumcision. It is obvious
that all the safeguards hitherto considered are
valueless unless the infant himself is in a perfectly
clean condition. The disinfection of the skin of an
adult before an operation is always a serious and
difficult matter, because the skin harbours so many
micro-organisms, including the very micro-cocci
referred to previously. Elaborate measures are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
therefore employed for the skin disinfection. But
in the case of an infant the skin cannot be supposed
to be such a probable source of wound infection.
It is sufficient that the genitals be washed about
half an hour before circumcision, with soap and
warm water, and subsequently a fomentation of
Boracic lint applied. It is as well to avoid the use
of the various baby powders which nurses are so
fond of sprinkling freely on the folds of the skin.
If it is thought desirable to employ such a dusting
powder, it should be a mixture of equal parts of
Boracic Acid and Starch.</p>

<p>The infant having been prepared as here stated,
the circumcision may proceed as soon as he is put
in position. Should any soiling have taken place,
the infant must again be cleansed, and in this case
the genitals must be washed with the Carbolic Acid
solution (1 in 40) by means of a swab of cotton wool.</p>

<span class="smaller u">Surgical Anatomy.</span></h2>

<p>It is essential for the Mohel to possess a knowledge
of the structure of the organ on which he
operates.</p>

<p>The skin of the penis is continuous on the upper
surface with the skin of the abdomen, and on the under
surface with that of the scrotum. On drawing forward
the prepuce or foreskin it is very easy to include
the skin of the scrotum in the grasp of the fingers
unless due care is taken. If the traction on the
foreskin is too forcible and the skin of the scrotum
is therefore pulled up tightly, there is a danger of
the scrotal skin being slit up to some extent. The
intimate connection of the skin of the penis and
scrotum must always be kept well in mind.</p>

<p>Under the foreskin and continuous with it at its
free margin there is a membrane which rising from
the neck or constriction below the glans envelops the
latter entirely up to the opening of the urethra.
Here it leaves the glans and joins the outer skin.
The name given to this structure is <em>mucous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
membrane</em>, and the method of dealing with it
constitutes the principal portion of the art of
circumcision.</p>

<p>This mucous membrane is the whitish glistening
structure which appears after the removal of the
skin.</p>

<p>It is important to note the disposition of this
mucous membrane, as revealed after the amputation
of the prepuce.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1) It usually <em>covers over the glans right up to the
orifice of the urethra</em>.</p>

<p>2) It may be reflected off the glans before reaching
this point, and become continuous with
or adherent to the skin lining. In this case
the glans will not be completely covered by
the mucous membrane, because a small
portion will have been cut off in the first
stage of the operation. In those cases the
membrane missing from the upper part of
the glans will be found on the inside of the
amputated foreskin.</p>

<p>3) In other cases this inner mucous membrane is
very deficient covering only three quarters
or less of the surface of the glans, the
remaining portion being adherent to the
inner surface of the foreskin.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>The <em>consistence of this membrane</em> is such that it
can be easily torn through but,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1) It may be elastic so that it stretches without
tearing.</p>

<p>2) It may be so thin that it is liable to be pushed
down by the nails instead of being torn.</p>

<p>3) It may be so thick as to necessitate the use
of the scissors to cut it.</p>

</div>

<p>It may be loosely applied to the glans so that the
thumb nails are easily inserted beneath it, or it may
be so adherent that great difficulty is experienced
in tearing it through and peeling it off the glans.</p>

<p>An important fold of this membrane, triangular
in shape is attached to the under surface of the
glans below its base reaching almost up to the
opening of the urethra. This is called the <em>FrÃ¦num</em>,
and it is fully exposed during the second stage of
the operation.</p>

<p>The body of the penis itself is composed of three
parts. On the upper surface behind the glans are
the two <em>Corpora Cavernosa</em>, united firmly together,
but leaving a hollow on their under surface for the
<em>Corpus Spongiosum</em> which is prolonged beyond them
in an enlarged extremity known as the <em>glans</em>. The
constriction beneath the glans is called the <em>Cervix
or Neck</em>, while the projecting rim of the glans above
this is called the <em>Corona</em>. Occasionally there are
found here small masses of soft creamy material,
which is the natural secretion of the part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The canal of the urethra runs in the corpus
spongiosum. Each of these three corpora is firmly
united to the pubic bone behind.</p>

<p>They are constructed of an outer sheath from the
inner surface of which numerous fine membranous
partitions stretch, dividing the whole up into
numerous small compartments. These compartments
are lined with a fine network of veins, which are
able to expand with blood and to distend and fill
up these spaces. When this occurs the whole organ
swells and becomes firm and the tension of the
fibrous material forming the main structure is
called into play so that the process assumes the
form of an erection. The veins which should drain
the penis of blood are compressed by the action of
certain muscles and this adds to the engorgement
of the organ.</p>

<p>When the penis of an infant is in a state of
erection the operation of circumcision can be more
easily performed and the dressing more efficiently
applied. The manipulation of the organ necessary
to grasp the prepuce is generally sufficient to
stimulate the increased blood supply requisite for
an erection. The skin of the penis does not share
with the rest of the organ, a greater amount of
blood during this state. It stretches by its own
elasticity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>All the arteries and veins of the penis run in the
deep structures previously alluded to, so that
circumcision, in an infant at any rate, can never
wound a blood vessel. The <em>FrÃ¦num is freely
supplied with blood</em>, and if cut will produce troublesome
hÃ¦morrhage, but a circumcision in no way
interferes with this part.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smaller u">Technique of Operation.</span></h2>

<p>A good light is essential for the performance of
circumcision.</p>

<p>The instruments required are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1) <em>Knife</em> of steel, to be made of one piece of
metal without joints, crevices or any ornamentation
whatsoever. The handle should
be stout enough to permit a firm grasp
upon it. The blade should be about 5
inches in length and fully half inch in
width.</p>

<p>2) <em>Shield.</em> This is a metal plate with a centre
slit, the edges of which are made to grasp
the prepuce at the level of the amputation.
The Shield protects both the glans penis
and the scrotum from injury by the knife.</p>

<p>3) <em>Scissors.</em> These are required occasionally to
cut through the mucous membrane. They
should be of the pattern known as the
â<em>blunt pointed</em>.â When it is evident that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the mucous membrane is very adherent to
the glans, the separation of these two
structures may be effected by the use of a
<em>Probe</em>. This is a thin metal rod which is
easily inserted under the mucous membrane
and swept round the glans so as to break
through the adhesions.</p>

</div>

<p>The person who is to hold the infant, is seated
on a chair with his feet on the side rail of a second
chair so as to keep the knees raised. The latter
must be kept close together. A firm pillow is
placed on the knees and the infant is laid thereon
facing the Mohel. When the necessary clothing
has been loosened, the thighs and knees are bent
up completely (flexed) and then the thighs are in
addition rotated outwards, and kept in this position
by the hands of the individual holding the infant.</p>

<p>The clothes should be displaced behind the
buttocks of the infant so as to raise the part.</p>

<p>The antiseptic preparations described in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter
iii.</a> having been carried out, the operation is performed
according to the following stages.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Stage I.</i> The root of the penis is taken between
the index and middle fingers of the right
hand palm downwards, and pressure is
made firmly backwards, the index finger
being against the scrotum, the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
finger against the lower portion of the abdomen.
This steadies the penis, keeps
away the skin of the scrotum, and helps
towards producing an erection.</p>

<p><i>Stage II.</i> Keeping these fingers in this position,
the <em>glans is grasped between the thumb and
index finger of the left hand</em>. It is important
not merely to take hold of the foreskin,
the glans must be included between the
fingers, and it must be examined by them
so as to discover where it ends. This is determined
by feeling the projecting rim of
the Corona, and the neck beneath it. The
skin overlying this marks the precise position
where the shield is to be placed. When
this position is accurately made out the
whole of the skin in front of it is withdrawn
beyond the glans by the fingers, and very
firmly held upwards away from the scrotum.</p>

<p><i>Stage III.</i> The fingers are now to be removed
from the root of the penis, and the shield
is taken into the right hand and adjusted
on the prepuce exactly at the level of the
finger tips which are grasping it. The
<em>direction of the shield is important</em>. It must
<em>not</em> be put on at right angles to the penis,
but obliquely upwards, i.e., the part of the
shield held in the hand must incline towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the abdomen of the infant, and the other part
away from it. In this way the circumcision
will take off the foreskin in a quill shape,
and it will leave a sufficient amount of
skin on the under surface of the penis.
If this precaution is not observed there is
a great risk of denuding the under surface
of the skin almost as far as the scrotum.</p>

<p><i>Stage IV.</i> The knife is then taken in the right
hand and with one sweep along the shield
the foreskin is amputated. The knife must
be handled firmly, and the cut made from
the heel. The cut circular edge of the skin
immediately retracts behind the corona,
though on the under surface the amount of
skin remaining may fall short of this level.</p>

<p><i>Stage V.</i> The amputated foreskin and the knife
are now put aside, the shield having already
fallen off. The Mohel will now, at a glance,
observe the disposition of the mucous membrane
covering the glans. He insinuates
the nail of one thumb under its edge, and
seizes it between the nail and the index
finger. When this is grasped the manÅuvre
is repeated with the thumbnail and
index finger of the other hand, keeping the
two hands close together. Before proceeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
further, the Mohel must be sure that
he has a firm hold of the membrane.</p>

<p class="sub">The next step is to tear the membrane
down in the centre, until the prominent
edge of the corona is exposed. This tearing
may be completed with one movement of the
hands, but if the membrane is long more
than one movement may be required to tear
it through completely.</p>

<p class="sub">When the neck below the corona is seen,
the flaps are reflected laterally backwards,
so that the torn edges of the mucous membrane
may join the cut edge of the skin.
Care must be taken that the membrane is
peeled off as far as possible (i.e. till its
junction with the frÃ¦num) from the under
surface of the glans and reflected directly
backwards so as to unite with the cut edge
of the skin.</p>

<p class="sub">The essence of the operation consists in
the proper performance of this stage. If
not performed efficiently the resulting circumcision
is very imperfect. The mistakes
usually made by beginners are as follows:</p>

<p class="sub">1) The mucous membrane is stretched without
being torn through; the glans then
projects completely giving the impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
that it has been exposed by the proper method.
2) The membrane is rolled back over
the glans instead of being torn back. 3) The
membrane is cleared off from the upper
surface of the glans, but is not sufficiently
peeled off from the under surface.</p>

<p><i>Stage VI.</i> The operation is really completed with
the preceding stage.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p class="sub">The practice of Metzizah may now be
carried out by means of a swab of sterilized,
cotton wool with which the penis is to be
firmly compressed. This will effectually
absorb the small amount of blood free in
the tissues and at the same time helps to
clean up the part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Stage VII.</i> The <em>dressing</em> consists of a strip of
sterilized and antiseptic lint or gauze long
enough to encircle the penis below the glans
two or three times, and wide enough to
cover the whole space between the corona
and the root of the penis, i.e. 4Â¼ in. Ã Â¾ in.
The first layer of dressing is applied entirely
below the glans and covers over the whole
of the reflected mucous membrane. Care
must be taken to apply this strip of lint at
the very root of the penis and to begin on
the under surface; otherwise there is a tendency
for the dressing in this latter position
only to just to reach the edge of the incision
and to push it back towards the scrotum and
thus increase the size of the raw area.</p>

<p class="sub">The glans must be quite free of the dressing
encircling the penis and must project
completely beyond the strip of lint applied
below it. This piece of lint or gauze adheres
quite well by itself, but to ensure its remaining
in position, it is better to secure it
by surrounding it once or twice with a
piece of sterilized tape and twisting up the
ends. <em>If this is done too tightly it may obstruct
the free flow of urine, or congest the
glans.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p class="sub">The dressing is completed by covering
over the naked and projecting glans with a
square piece of antiseptic gauze. A diaper
folded in the ordinary triangular shape is
then put on, and this is secured firmly by
means of broad tape. Two or three turns
must be given round the thighs so as to keep
them fixed, and the ends are to be tied over
the hip.</p>

<p class="sub">During the after treatment the re-dressing
may be regulated as follows. After about
10 or 12 hours, but at any rate within the
first 24 hours, the piece of gauze covering
the glans must be removed and the tape
surrounding the dressing untwisted and also
removed. If the circumcision has been properly
and carefully performed, so that the
whole of the mucous membrane and skin are
kept back by the dressing, and the whole of
the glans remains exposed, nothing further
need be done but to replace some fresh
gauze over the glans. On the following
day the whole of the dressing should be
removed, and gauze be re-applied around the
penis leaving the end of the glans free. This
dressing will fall off when the infant is in
the bath, and may be renovated as often as
necessary. As an alternative procedure the
whole dressing may be removed after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
first 24 hours, and the part re-dressed with
gauze.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The performance of Metzizah according to statutory
Jewish Law consists of suction by the mouth. The original
sources of this practice indicate that it was considered an
essential part of the operation in the same way as the
dressing of the wound was. Failure to carry out this
measure was regarded as constituting a serious risk to the
infant. The possible dangers of this practice have become
obvious during recent years and direct suction of the wound
is, from every point of view, inadmissible. In order to carry
out the ancient practice a device is used by some Mohelim
by which the suction is performed through a small glass
tube with a perforation at its end and containing a piece of
absorbent wool in its interior.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 class="u">Circumcision in Abnormal Cases.</h3>

<p>The penis is subject to many departures from its
usual anatomy, but here it will only be necessary to
notice some of the more usual abnormalities.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>1st.</i> In some cases the penis is sunken into the pubic
skin, so that on grasping the prepuce the whole
integument of the penis is pulled up leaving the
organ itself buried in the skin behind. It will
be found that in many of these cases the testicles
have not descended into the scrotum. The first
stage of the operation, in these instances, is all
important. The root of the penis is embraced
between the second and third fingers of the right
hand as previously explained and firm pressure
backwards is made until a definite erection is
made. The amount of skin to be amputated
must be very accurately estimated, the shield
carefully adjusted in an oblique direction, as in
these cases the inclusion of some of the skin of
the scrotum is very easy. The mucous membrane
often proves to be very thick, but whatever its
consistence may be it should be cut away with
scissors after reflection as this proceeding helps
to prevent the glans sinking back into the skin.
A careful examination of the infant must be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
in these cases because they frequently denote
immature development, and call for postponement
of the performance of the circumcision.</p>

<p><i>2nd.</i> The prepuce is sometimes deficient. The upper
portion of the glans may be exposed and project
beyond the short prepuce. The amount of the
latter which should be removed is so small, that
on pulling it forward there is not sufficient in
the small circle of skin for the fingers to obtain
a firm grasp. In this case forceps should be
employed to hold the foreskin.</p>

<p><i>3rd.</i> Some infants are born apparently circumcised.
On examination it will be found that a considerable
amount of prepuce still remains on the upper
surface of the penis, while the under surface may
be quite free. In these cases the whole of the
remaining prepuce is grasped between the fingers
and the operation is performed in the usual manner.
Here also the underlying mucous membrane
should be entirely cut away after it has been
torn through.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller u">Repair of the Wound.</span></h2>

<p>As the whole difference between a scientific operator
and a merely mechanical Mohel lies in an
appreciation of the process of repair in the wound
inflicted, it becomes necessary to consider this in
detail.</p>

<p>The area of the circumcision wound extends between
the corona of the glans and the circular cut edge
of the skin. The skin of the penis always retracts,
so that if the shield has been placed in the position
previously indicated, the skin will not after the
circumcision reach quite up to the corona; the neck
of the glans will be well exposed. This is the condition
to be attained in ritual circumcision.</p>

<p>The mucous membrane, after being torn through
and reflected covers over the area of the resulting
wound. <em>The planning of the operation should be so
carried out that the torn edges of the mucous membrane
may unite with the cut edge of the skin.</em> This
approximation is not usually complete all round the
wound. The tearing through of the mucous membrane
produces a narrow V shaped rent; this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
widened out when the membrane is reflected, and
if carefully apposed to the cut skin, will unite with
it. But the edge of that portion of the membrane
peeled off from the under surface of the glans will
often fail to unite with the exit edge of the skin on
the under surface of the penis. It frequently does
not reach as far back as the cut skin, especially when
the foreskin has been freely removed or when the
mucous membrane has a tendency to curl up. The
result in the majority of circumcisions is that the
upper portion of the wound heals rapidly, where the
lacerated edge of the mucous membrane has united
to the cut edge of the skin, while on the under surface,
the mucous membrane will adhere to the raw
surface of the penis left by the retracting skin, but
there will probably be a gap where the membrane
has failed to reach the cut edge of the skin. This
gap will necessarily be very small when the reflection
of the mucous membrane has been complete. Where
approximation of the two edges occurs union is rapid
and healing by âfirst intentionâ results. Where some
loss of substance occurs the gap becomes gradually
filled by what is called <em>granulation tissue</em>, and the
term âsecond intentionâ is given to the healing
process.</p>

<h3 class="u">Healing by first intention.</h3>

<p>In amputating the foreskin a number of minute
hair-like blood vessels which permeate the skin are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
cut through. There is little or no bleeding, because
the blood immediately clots, and almost at once a
rim of coagulum is formed at the margin of the circumcision.
Besides this the injury destroys a minute
amount of living tissue known as <em>connective tissue
cells</em>. The wound causes a special degree of activity
in the adjacent blood vessels, so that certain important
constituents of the blood flow out of the vessels
and invade the cut margin where the blood has
coagulated.</p>

<p>This invasion consists of the fluid portion of the
blood&mdash;or lymph, and the solid elements called
white corpuscles&mdash;or leucocytes. These latter remove
the cells which have been killed by the injury, and
get rid of the blood clot, probably by a process of
digestion. When this is effected, the way is paved
for the healing, i.e. the formation of the scar.</p>

<p>The naked-eye evidence of all this is to be found
in the moisture or exudation on the surface of a
wound. As this forms on both surfaces of a wound,
the exudation is the first bond of union. The fluid
portion of this exudation becomes absorbed, and
what remains of it forms the scaffolding on which
the scar is built up. The scar consists of new connective
tissue cells which have grown into this
framework, and multiplied rapidly, causing firm
cohesion of the two separate surfaces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>In order that these new cells should be properly
nourished they require a sufficient blood supply,
and it is found that while their formation is proceeding
minute new blood vessels shoot forth from the
existing ones, and they grow into the soft newly
developing scar tissue. Owing to this fact, free
oozing of blood takes place when a healing wound is
disturbed.</p>

<p>In the operation of circumcision it is well seen
how the circulation of the blood re-acts to injury.
When the mucous membrane covering the glans is
exposed it looks pale and translucent, because of its
scanty blood supply and its thinness. Very soon
after it has been torn through, its whole character
changes. It becomes engorged with blood, it becomes
red and congested it loses its translucency,
and at its lacerated edge the process of healing takes
place as detailed above.</p>

<p>All scars are at first pink in colour, because more
new blood vessels are formed than are required for
the permanent nourishment of the part when completely
healed. In the course of time these blood
vessels shrink and waste away and the scar becomes
whiter even than the adjacent skin. This occurs
also in the mucous membrane which remains pink
for a considerable time. The membrane in fact undergoes
the first stage of inflammation as a reaction
to the injury it has sustained. The blood vessels
become enormously dilated, and its blood supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
increased. It presents the best conditions for healing
along the edges where it has been torn, but the
whole of its outer surface also, which, after reflection
becomes opposed to the raw surface between the
corona and the cut foreskin inferiorly, becomes
united by a similar process to this raw area.</p>

<p>In those cases where the reflection of the mucous
membrane has not been perfect a gap will be left
between its margin and the cut foreskin, in which
healing takes place by <em>granulation or second
intention</em>.</p>

<p>The details of this method of healing are similar
to the first; the discharge or exudation from the
wound takes place in the same manner, but as there
are not two surfaces to unite to each other, this
exudation simply covers over the wound in the form
of a whitish or pale yellow layer of <em>lymph</em>. The
fluid discharge should be tolerably clear; if it tends
to be thick or milk like in colour it indicates that
there has been some accidental contamination of
the wound, or that the vital powers necessary for
normal healthy repair are below the average. It
shows that the inflammatory re-action of the tissues
which is the essential requisite for healing has been
excessive. In this case not only has the wound been
invaded by the white blood cells, which as previously
explained, form the groundwork of the new tissue
cells; but a further step has taken place. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
white cells have been thrown off the surface of the
wound and together with the exuded fluid go to
form â<em>pus</em>â or <em>matter</em>. All this causes delay in the
healing. But eventually the wound becomes filled
up by the growth of new connective tissue cells;
these continue to multiply until the surface is
reached, when the uppermost or epithelial layer of
the cut edge of the adjoining skin grows over it,
constituting a continuous skin covering.</p>

<p>The <em>defects in the healing process</em> may therefore be
briefly summed as being due to some interference
with the natural course of physiological repair.
They may be comprised under the following heads.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1) Deficient vitality of the infant.</p>

<p>2) Infection of wound.</p>

<p>3) Imperfect performance of the operation especially
when the tearing through and reflection of
the mucous membrane has been incomplete.</p>

</div>

<p>These defects are to be prevented by a careful
examination of the health of the infant previously
to the circumcision, by the employment of Antiseptic
measures, and by carefully carrying out the
technique of the operation.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smaller u">HÃ¦morrhage.</span></h2>

<p>Trouble from bleeding is an exceedingly rare
occurrence at the circumcision of an infant, because
no arteries or veins are cut through. But the
possibility of its occurrence, however, remains, and
therefore some points regarding it should come
within the information of every Mohel. It will be
his duty to apply first aid, and consequently a
knowledge of the principles of the treatment of
hÃ¦morrhage should be familiar to him.</p>

<p>There are <em>three varieties of bleeding</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1st. <em>Capillary.</em> This consists of the oozing of blood
from various points on a cut surface. The
vessels are minute hair-like structures, and bleeding
from them is invariably stopped by firm
pressure. This loss of blood occurs in more or
less degree at every circumcision, and in the
vast majority of cases is arrested by the natural
process previously explained.</p>

<p>2nd. <em>Arterial.</em> The distinctive sign of this kind of
bleeding is that it issues forth from the wound
in spurts, and not in a continuous stream. Each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
spurt corresponds to a heart beat. This variety
of hÃ¦morrhage can only occur if an artery is cut
through, i.e., a vessel which carries blood away
from the heart to supply the tissues of the body.</p>

<p>3rd. <em>Venous.</em> This bleeding is due to the wound of
a vessel which returns blood to the heart after
it has circulated through the tissues. These
vessels are called veins. The blood is dark in
colour and issues from one definite spot in a
continuous stream.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Treatment.</em> For practical purposes only the first
variety of hÃ¦morrhage need be considered here.
Circumcision in an infant should never interfere
with an artery or vein; but in the event of this
accident occurring a pledget of cotton-wool or
lint must be firmly compressed with bandage
around the bleeding point until the proper method
can be adopted to deal with it. This consists of
seizing the bleeding point with an instrument
constructed for the purpose (artery forceps) and
then twisting up the tissue caught in the forceps,
or applying a ligature. This is a purely surgical
proceeding, and as every case of hÃ¦morrhage should
without delay receive qualified medical attention
nothing further need be said on this matter here.</p>

<p>In most cases the application of the dressing with
very firm pressure suffices to arrest the inevitable
bleeding of every circumcision. <em>The bandaging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
cannot be considered satisfactory until the blood
ceases to ooze through the dressing.</em> In adjusting
the diapers it must be seen that the thighs are tied
together so that they are immovable, perfect rest
being indispensable for the control of hÃ¦morrhage.
This treatment is merely a mechanical aid to the
natural processes which arrest bleeding, and in the
vast majority of cases is perfectly successful.</p>

<p>There are however certain drugs which may be
applied to a bleeding surface to hasten the coagulation
of the blood. These are called <em>astringents</em>.
These are not to be used indiscriminately as many
of them injure the tissues and interfere with the
healing of the wound. If pressure alone is insufficient
to stop the hÃ¦morrhage and the local application
of an astringent is to be tried, the part must first be
carefully washed with an antiseptic solution, so as
to see precisely where the bleeding is actually coming
from. Strips of lint soaked in the astringent
solution are then carefully applied and retained in
position by the firm pressure of a bandage.</p>

<p>The following are the principal drugs which may
be used in this way.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1.) Compound Tincture of Benzoin.</p>

<p>2.) Tincture of Hazeline.</p>

<p>3.) Strong solution of Alum in hot water.</p>

<p>4.) Solution of Tannic Acid (4 grains to the ounce.)</p>

<p>5.) Solution of Adrenalin Chloride.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>The last of these has the reputation of being the
most powerful astringent known.</p>

<p>A solution of Perchloride of Iron is often used,
but this is open to the objection of injuring the
delicate living tissues.</p>

<h3 class="u">Secondary HÃ¦morrhage.</h3>

<p>Besides the bleeding which may occur immediately
on the infliction of a wound, there is another
variety which may take place subsequently, known
as Secondary HÃ¦morrhage. This occurs when there
is some failure in the process previously described,
by which the wound heals. The coagulum is disturbed
and the vessels are practically re-opened, or
the coagulum <em>becomes softened through the action of
an infective agent</em>. As a rule secondary hÃ¦morrhage
indicates some form of infection.</p>

<p>Often in changing the dressing there is a minute
amount of hÃ¦morrhage. This is due to injuring
the developing blood vessels in the newly growing
scar tissue.</p>

<h3 class="u">HÃ¦morrhage due to constitutional conditions.</h3>

<p>Some infants are born with a tendency to bleed,
without any evident cause, either from the nose,
bowels, or in the skin. The separation of the navel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
may be followed by bleeding. Many of these cases
are due to hereditary disease of one character or
another. Of these, there is one which requires
special mention, because when fatal hÃ¦morrhage
has occurred after circumcision it has been due to
it. This is <em>HÃ¦mophilia</em>. Subjects of this disease
are called <em>Bleeders</em>, and it usually only affects males.
It runs in families, one or two members may be
affected while the rest are free. The females in a
family of âbleedersâ, though they may not suffer
themselves, transmit the disease to their children.
In this condition the slightest injury will start
profuse hÃ¦morrhage. The use of a toothbrush may
be sufficient to cause severe bleeding from the
gums. If the family history of any child reveals
the presence of this disease circumcision must not
be performed. Should the operation have taken
place in ignorance of the condition the difficulty in
controlling the hÃ¦morrhage, and its recurrence if
at all relieved will at once confirm the presence of
HÃ¦mophilia. The nature of the bleeding in this
condition is that referred to before as <em>Capillary</em>.</p>

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
